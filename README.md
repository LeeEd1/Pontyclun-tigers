# Pontyclun Tigers

Pontyclun tigers is a branch of Steve Tottle Tae Kwon Do (TKD) located in Pontyclun, South wales. Our aim is to enrol as many children between the ages of 3 and 6 and with encouragement and support, kick start their journey into the TKD world! Established in 2018 We have secured our own unit with all the necessary equipment for any child to become a young tiger.

Our ultimate goal of this website is to raise as much awareness as possible for Pontyclun tigers, introduce ourselves and show everyone what we are able to offer.

## Design

### Typography:

Merriweather was selected for all Headings and Nav Bar with Monserrat selected for all other content on the page. I chose these after many google searches because i found them to be easy on the eye and very clear to read.

### Colour Scheme:

The colour scheme was based around the logo and general colours of the tigers club.

All images were taken from the client except the two main images which were sourced through pexels.

### WireFrames:

## Features

### NavBar

This is the navbar for both desktop and tablet devices, I decided to keep full nav bar for tablet as it is one less click for the user.

Below is the navbar for mobile devices which collapses to a Hamburger.

### Home page:

The hero image for the landing page is the gym the students will be training in with the equiplment that will be used. I feel this is important as it gives potential members a flavour of what to expect prior to attending the venue. This page also displays a degree of dedication and authenticity from the club due to the quality and range of equpiment and space. As shown below.

Below the hero image is a detailed histology of how the club was established. This was provided by the client.

The last section of the home page is the potential benefits of TKD.
