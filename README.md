# Pontyclun Tigers

Pontyclun tigers is a branch of Steve Tottle Tae Kwon Do located in Pontyclun, South wales. Our aim is to recruit as many children between the ages of 3 and 6 to kick start their journey into the TKD world! Established in 2018 We have secured our own unit with all the necessary equipment for any child to become a young tiger.

Our ultimate goal is to raise as much awareness as we can for Pontyclun tigers, intorduce ourselves and show everyone what we are about!

## Design

### Typography:

Merriweather was selected for all Headings and Nav Bar with Monserrat selected for all other content on the page. I chose these after many google searches because i found them to be easy on the eye and very clear to read.

### Colour Scheme:

The colour scheme was based around the logo and general colours of the tigers club.

All images were taken from the client except the two main images which were sourced through pexels.

### WireFrames:

## Features

### NavBar

This is the navbar for both desktop and tablet devices, I decided to keep full nav bar for tablet as it is one less click for the user.

Below is the navbar for mobile devices which collapses to a Hamburger.

### Footer:

Social media links along with youtube were added to the footer for more viewing pleasure, I also decided to add site map below for the user to quickly access the other pages as shown below.

### Home page:

The hero image for the landing page is the gym the students will be training in, I felt this was important as it shows how dedicated and authentic this club really is, as shown below.

Below the hero image is a genuine and detailed truth of who and how the club came to be.
