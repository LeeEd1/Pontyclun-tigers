# Pontyclun Tigers

Pontyclun tigers is a branch of Steve Tottle Tae Kwon Do located in Pontyclun, South wales. Our aim is to recruit as many children between the ages of 3 and 6 to kick start their journey into the TKD world! Established in 2018 We have secured our own unit with all the necessary equipment for any child to become a young tiger.

Our ultimate goal is to raise as much awareness as we can for Pontyclun tigers, intorduce ourselves and show everyone what we are about!
